# Welcome to Gift Ghar

This is a proof of concept for an app that was created during a recruitment assignment for Idealoft Studio.

The brief provided was, "Design a digital product for Indians living in foreign countries to gift their loved ones in India."

Concept-
GiftGhar is an innovative app that intuitively assists foreign nationals to send gifts to their friends and family back home in India. It serves as a better mechanism than amazon or other e-commerce platforms as it incorporates a suggestion mechanism based on “why?”, “when?, “who?” and “where?” the gift is being sent to.

The product shall be a responsive ReactJS App that can function on Mobile and Desktops. It shall utilise React’s component architecture for smoother usage and easier development going forward.

The basic concept is to make gift shopping easier by eliminating the cognitive load of selecting gifts out of random options. This filtering mechanism right now will use keyword based architecture but in the future, it can shift to a ML powered mechanism for better recommendation capabilities.

For the purposes of this assignment, there will be a limited dataset of 30 gifts that will be categorised only on the basis of occasion due to time constraints. However, there will be a possibility for further filtering available after further development of code.

If you wish to refer to its documentation, you can refer to the Figma Document made for the assignment.
